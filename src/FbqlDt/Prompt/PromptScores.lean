-- FqlDt.Prompt.PromptScores - Complete PROMPT score with computed overall
--
-- The PROMPT framework scores evidence on 6 dimensions:
-- - Provenance: Where does this come from?
-- - Replicability: Can it be reproduced?
-- - Objective: Is it free from bias?
-- - Methodology: Is the method sound?
-- - Publication: Is it properly published/peer-reviewed?
-- - Transparency: Is the process open?
--
-- The overall score is the average of all 6, computed with proof.

/-- Complete PROMPT scores with all 6 dimensions plus computed overall.

The `overall` field is constrained to equal the average of the 6 dimensions.
This is enforced at the type level via `overall_correct`. -/
